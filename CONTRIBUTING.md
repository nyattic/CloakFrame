# Contributing to CloakFrame

Thank you for helping improve CloakFrame. Bug reports and focused pull requests
are welcome.

## Report a problem

Open a GitHub issue and include:

- What you were doing and what happened
- What you expected instead
- CloakFrame version and operating system
- Whether the input was an image or video and which detector was selected
- Relevant activity-log output with private paths or filenames removed

Do not attach private photos or videos unless you have explicitly decided they
are safe to share. A small synthetic sample is preferred for reproductions.

## Prepare a change

1. Build the project and run the tests described in [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md).
2. Keep changes focused and add regression coverage for changed behavior.
3. Run the repository formatting and static-analysis checks.
4. Update Korean, English, Japanese, and Simplified Chinese UI translations
   when user-visible strings change.
5. Add or update the release notes for a user-visible change. Each version has
   one file per language: `release-notes/<version>.ko.md`, `.en.md`, and
   `.ja.md`. CI fails when any of the three is missing for the current project
   version.
6. Update all three READMEs when user instructions change.

The local quality-gate commands are:

```bash
cmake --preset debug -DCLOAKFRAME_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS=ON
cmake --build --preset debug --parallel
ctest --preset debug --parallel
cmake --build --preset debug --target cloakframe_format_check
cmake --build --preset debug --target cloakframe_tidy --parallel
node --test .github/scripts/update-download-badge.test.js
```

Use the `cloakframe_format` target to apply formatting. The formatter and tidy
targets are available only when their LLVM tools are found during CMake
configuration; see [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md#developer-checks) for explicit tool
paths.

## Safety and compatibility

CloakFrame handles privacy-sensitive media. A change must preserve these core
properties:

- Never modify an input file in place.
- Never silently overwrite an existing output.
- Never upload media or derived personal data.
- Fail closed when processing cannot prove that the requested masking finished.
- Keep updater and downloaded-model integrity checks intact.

Avoid changing supported operating-system, Qt, OpenCV, ONNX Runtime, model, or
FFmpeg baselines without updating CI, packaging scripts, and documentation in
the same pull request.

[The 2026-08-06 audit](docs/cloakframe-audit-2026-08-06.md) records how each of
these properties is currently enforced, which findings are still open, and the
reproduction steps for them. Read the status table at the top of that document
before working on privacy coverage, the video timeline, publication, or the
updater, and update it when a finding changes state.

## Dependencies and licenses

Record any new runtime dependency and its license in
[THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt). Dependencies linked into the
application must be compatible with `GPL-3.0-or-later`, and redistributable
files must be included by every affected packaging path.
